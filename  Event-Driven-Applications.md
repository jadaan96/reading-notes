## Readings: Event Driven Applications
#### Why is the topic of stacks and queues important in relation to your studies in this module?
>Event-driven programming is crucial as it offers a versatile and effective method for managing events, asynchronous tasks, and user interactions. Its significance is particularly evident in situations where responsiveness, modularity, extensibility, and scalability are key factors to consider, such as web applications, graphical user interfaces (GUI), real-time systems, and networked applications.

#### 1-What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?
events module


#### 2- What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?
>Object-oriented programming (OOP) greatly aids in the organization of code by creating reusable objects, thereby simplifying management and maintenance. OOP facilitates the encapsulation of data and behavior, resulting in cleaner and more modular code. When used in conjunction with Event-Driven Programming, OOP empowers us to develop event handlers as object methods, enhancing code structure and readability.

#### 3- Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

>Utilizing Node.js on the backend, Event-Driven Programming proves to be highly beneficial as it enables developers to construct highly responsive applications. Similar to how events in a web browser trigger actions like form submissions, events on the backend can be employed to handle incoming requests, database queries, or external API calls. By leveraging Event-Driven Programming, Node.js efficiently handles multiple requests concurrently, resulting in scalability and responsiveness. This approach is particularly advantageous for building real-time applications, such as collaborative tools, where immediate responses are of utmost importance.
