### The important of this topic is:
Studying different database types is essential in my module as it helps me understand how to effectively store and manage data. This knowledge enables me to make informed decisions during system design and contributes to my overall success in studying data management.
#### nosql vs sql
1-What type of database is the best fit for the complex query intensive environment? **SQL database.**
2- Best fit for hierarchical data storage: **Hierarchical database.** 
3-Scalability difference between SQL and NoSQL: **SQL may require more resources to scale, while NoSQL can scale easily.**

#### sql modeling techniques

1- Among data tables, what is a one-to-many relationship and how do we “relate” them?
**A one-to-many relationship connects one record in a table to multiple records in another table.**

2- Prior to designing your relational database, it might be useful to ___ a ___ of the database tables and their relationships.
**Creating a diagram helps visualize the tables and their relationships.**

3 - Explain the difference between a primary and foreign key.
 > A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table.

> A foreign key links a table to the primary key of another table.

 #### sql vs nosql
 1- How do we treat keywords and parameters differently in SQL syntax?
> Keywords in SQL have reserved meanings and cannot be used as identifiers for tables or columns without special handling. Parameters, on the other hand, are values passed into SQL queries to make them dynamic and reusable.

2-Define normalization within the context of schemas and data.
>Normalization organizes a database to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity by breaking down large tables, establishing relationships, and minimizing duplication and anomalies.


3- Explain the difference between one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships to a non-technical recruiter.

* One-to-One Relationship: Each record in one table has a unique connection to one record in another table.

* One-to-Many Relationship: Each record in one table can have multiple relationships with records in another table.

* Many-to-Many Relationship: Records in one table can have multiple connections with records in another table.
