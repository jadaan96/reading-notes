# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** is a method of managing access to computer systems or data based on the roles and responsibilities of users within an organization. In RBAC, users are assigned specific roles, and each role has predefined permissions associated with it. Users can perform actions and access resources based on their assigned roles, making it a structured and efficient way to control access.

## Example of RBAC

In an RBAC system, roles and associated permissions can be illustrated with a simple example related to managing a blog platform:

- **Roles**:
  - **Admin**: Can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) blog posts, manage user accounts.
  - **Editor**: Can create, read, and update blog posts.
  - **Author**: Can create and read blog posts.
  - **Reader**: Can only read blog posts.

This example shows how different roles have different levels of access and permissions in a content management system.

## Benefits of RBAC

The benefits of RBAC include:

- **Access Control**: RBAC provides fine-grained control over who can access what resources.
- **Simplicity**: It simplifies access management by grouping users into roles.
- **Scalability**: Easy to add or modify roles and permissions as the organization grows.
- **Security**: Helps prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.
- **Auditability**: Facilitates tracking and auditing of user actions.
