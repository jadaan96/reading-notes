#### Socket.io Chat Example
##### Explain to a non-technical recruiter what the Chat Example (above) does.

> The Chat Example refers to a fundamental chat application that facilitates live communication among users. It comprises a React-based frontend, a Node.js and Express.js-based backend, and incorporates Socket.IO for real-time messaging functionality.


##### What proof of life are we getting on the backend from the above app?
>The proof of life we are getting on the backend from the above app is the console log message "a user connected" whenever a user establishes a connection with the Socket.IO serve

##### Socket.IO gives us the i0.emit() method to send an event to everyone. What flag would you use if you want to send a message to everyone except for a certain emitting socket?
>To send a message to everyone except for a certain emitting socket using Socket.IO, you can use the broadcast flag.

#### Rooms
##### What is a room and how might a room be useful?


Rooms group sockets together for targeted messaging in various scenarios: group chat, private messaging, and notifications.

##### How do you join a room?

IO, you can use the join() method 
##### how do you leave a room?


IO, you can use the leave() method 
### Namespaces
#### What is a Namespace and what does it allow you to do?


A namespace is a feature that enables the creation of separate communication channels within a Socket.IO server instance. It facilitates the organization and division of sockets into distinct groups based on a shared purpose or functionality.
#### Each namespace potentially has its own what? (hint: 3 things)

* Sockets
 * Rooms
 * Events
 #### Discuss a possible use case for separate namespaces
 In a multi-tenant application, separate namespaces in Socket.IO can be used to create isolated environments for different organizations or clients. Each namespace serves as a distinct communication channel, allowing real-time interactions without affecting others.
