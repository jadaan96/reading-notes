### why this topic matters
##### Data Structures and Algorithms are important because they:

>Data Structures and algorithms are important because they enable efficient problem solving, optimize performance.
##### What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
> what is the purpose you need it for because each data structure have its own advantage and disadvantage
##### How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
> by starting with the base case which the recursive call will stop at .
#### Things I want to know more about:
> big O and who to let the function less complicated
